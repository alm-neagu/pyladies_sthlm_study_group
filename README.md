## Meetup Details: [ONLINE] Study Group 📖: Python for Data Analysis

Are you interested in data analysis with Python but do not know where to start? Then this is the place for you. In this bi-weekly study group we will go through 1-2 chapters of the book “Python for Data Analysis” (Wes McKinney, 2nd edition). The focus is on Python programming and different libraries for data analysis.

This meetup is for you who wants to learn how to best take advantage of specific Python libraries used for data analysis like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels. During the meetup we will discuss what we’ve learned, tackle difficult problems together and learn from each other. Most importantly we will support each other through the process of learning.

💭 Group discussions are the best way to learn something new and have someone else motivating you to reach the finish line!
